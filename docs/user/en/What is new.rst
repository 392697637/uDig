This license change has enabled the uDig project to
`apply <http://locationtech.org/proposals/user-friendly-desktop-internet-gis-udig>`_ to the Eclipse Foundation
`LocationTech <http://locationtech.org>`_ industry working group.

GeoScript Editor
================

uDig is pleased to directly offer a scripting environment for the first time.  Scripting is one of the powerful techniques in a Geospaital Information System 
allowing non-developers the ability to automate common tasks.

For more information check out the `geoscript <http://geoscript.org/>`_ project.

We also have a hands on tutorial on using the :doc:`/getting_started/The Geoscript Editor`.

Documents
=========

The :doc:`/reference/Document view` added to list resource and feature documents.

Attachments and links:

- Resource attachments: Attach files and web links to a layer for easy access
- Feature attachments:  Attach files and web links to individual features
- Attachments are copied in the same fashion as email attachments, alternatively both web and file links are supported (and are not copied).
- Out of the box support for Shapefile attachments, files are stored in a folder next to your shapefile

Feature Hotlinks:

- Configure an attribute to act as a *hotlinks* for file or website
- Or define custom action to open a local action or fire off a google search using an attribute value
